# Jorge Viñals Site - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **CSS/HTML Structure Mismatch**
   - The HTML was using a container-based structure but loading `main-v3-clean.css` which expected a table structure
   - Fixed by changing to `main-v4.css` which matches the container structure

2. **Page Visibility Issue**
   - The page had `opacity: 0` by default and only became visible when JavaScript added the `loaded` class
   - Added `visibility-fix.css` to ensure the page becomes visible after 3 seconds even if JS fails
   - Added a JavaScript fallback that forces visibility after 3 seconds
   - Added default CSS variables for background images

3. **JavaScript Selector Fix**
   - Fixed `randomizer.js` to use `.title-container h1` instead of `.page-title h1`

## Current Setup

### Files Modified:
- `/index.html` - Updated to use correct CSS and added fallbacks
- `/assets/js/randomizer.js` - Fixed h1 selector
- `/assets/css/visibility-fix.css` - Created to ensure visibility

### Test Pages Created:
- `/test-summary.html` - Overview of all components and their status
- `/index-immediate.html` - Version with immediate styling (no JS required)
- `/index-diagnostic.html` - Diagnostic version with console output
- `/debug-test.html` - Simple debug version

## How to Test

1. The dev server is already running on port 8080
